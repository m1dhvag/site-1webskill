			<h1><b>Celebrating Steve</b></h1>
			<p>
			Statement from the Jobs family

For a decade now, mourning and healing have gone together.

Our gratitude has become as great as our loss.

Each of us has found his or her own path to consolation,but we have come together in a beautiful place of love
for Steve, and for what he taught us.

For all of Steve’s gifts, it was his power as a teacher that has endured.

He taught us to be open to the beauty of the world, to be curious around new ideas, to see around the next corner, and most of all to stay humble in our own beginner’s mind.

There are many things we still see through his eyes, but he also taught to look for ourselves. He gave us equipment for living,and it has served us well.

One of our greatest sources of consolation has been our association of Steve with beauty. The sight of something beautiful — a wooded hillside, a well‑made object — recalls his spirit to us. Even in his years of suffering, he never lost his faith in the beauty of existence.

Memory is inadequate for what is in our hearts: we miss him profoundly.
We were blessed to have him as husband and father.

			<h1><b>Steve Jobs gems keep surfacing on YouTube </b></h1>
			<p>
			Finding myself with a bit more free time on my hands than usual, and this being the year where we’ll be mourning the 10-year anniversary of Steve’s passing, I decided to update the website with content that I had been coming across recently.

After Steve passed in 2011, I fully expected things about him to come out (say, books that would not have been dared to be written while he was alive), but I also expected this to taper down after a few years. I certainly didn’t expect super well preserved, full-length interviews from 30 years ago to emerge. Well, boy was I wrong. I’ve been amazed at the content that YouTube (All Bow to the Almighty Algorithm!) surfaced to me this past week. Take a look!
